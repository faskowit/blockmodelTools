blockmodeltools (beta)
==============================

Toolbox of functions designed to aid in the usage of the [wsbm package](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/wsbm/). Work on these tools is ongoing.

The WSBM is an egde-generative model of community structure. Notably, it can identify community strucutre topologies beyond modularity (internally dense, externally sparse), such as core-periphery and disassortaitve structures. 

These tools have been used to identify [community structure changes across the lifespan](https://github.com/faskowit/Faskowitz2018wsbmLifeSpan) and to evaluate [community structure patterns of the rat cortex connectome](https://github.com/faskowit/Faskowitz2019wsbmRatBrain).
